üöÄ How to Set Up and Run the Project
To clone and run this application, you'll need to set up your own Firebase project.

1. Firebase Project Setup
Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

Add a new Android app to the project.

Package Name: com.example.devsecit_ambulance_driver (or your own package name, but you'll need to update it in the app).

Follow the instructions to download the google-services.json file and place it in the android/app/ directory of this project.

Enable the following Firebase services in the console:

Authentication: Enable the "Phone Number" sign-in provider. You will also need to add your device's SHA-1 and SHA-256 fingerprints to your Firebase project settings for OTP to work on a real device.

Firestore: Create a new database in Test Mode.

Storage: Create a new storage bucket.

2. Firestore Database Structure
You will need to create two collections in Firestore:

drivers: This stores driver information. The document ID should be the Firebase uid of the user.

ride_requests: This stores information about each ride.

For the required fields in each collection, please refer to the Project Report documentation.
